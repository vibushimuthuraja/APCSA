class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    //Use the // to create single line comments to either add info or to take out code for debugging

    System.out.println("Hello world!");

    //We will be using System.out.println and System.out.print throughout the year. Try using both below to see what the difference is!


    System.out.print("hi");
    System.out.println("hello");


    //ANSWER: System.out.println prints the text in quotations then goes to the next line, System.out.print prints the text and stays on the same line



    //Throughout the year this year we will need to store information. For that we will be using VARIABLES!

    //Java is an Object-Oriented programming language. All variables we use this year will either be OBJECTS or PRIMITIVES

    //There are 8 primitives in Java: int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean, char

    //For AP we need to know: int, double, boolean

    //List examples of the types below and give definition
    //int (integer): int is a number like 3
    //double: double is a decimal with a float(.)
    //boolean: boolean is a true or false value which means a binary value

    //For now we are just going to work with primitive

    //Create 3 variables of each of the above types (USE GOOD CODING PRACTICE WHEN CREATING THE VARIABLES
    int myGrade= 3;
    int myAge= 16;
    int myBirthday = 4;
    double myGPA= 4.0;
    double glucoseLevel= 7.6;
    double hemoglobinA1C= 6.5;
    boolean cat= true;
    boolean dog= false;
    boolean elephant= true;





    //MATH TIME!

    //What are the math operators that we can use?
    //+ - * / % addition, subraction, multiplication, division, mod

    //Try doing some math operations with numbers. How can we check to see if the math worked?
    System.out.println(3+4);
    System.out.println(3*4);
    System.out.println(4-3);
    System.out.println(8/4);
    System.out.println(8%4);
    //We can check that the math worked by checking in our head 




    //Create codes that will print the following:

    //Odd integers from 1 to 100, inclusive of both



    //All multiples of 3 from 1 to 100




    //Starting at 1000, print on the same line (with a - [hypthen] between each) all of the numbers that end in 0 going down to 0
